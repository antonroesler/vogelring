## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Bird Sighting Management**: Record, edit, and track bird sightings with detailed metadata
- **Ring Database**: Comprehensive database of ringed birds with identification and tracking
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize sightings on interactive maps with location accuracy indicators
- **Advanced Search**: Powerful search functionality with partial ring reading support (wildcards)
- **Family Trees**: Track breeding relationships and family lineages between birds

### Analytics & Insights

- **Friend Analysis**: Discover which birds are frequently seen together
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Analyze seasonal migration and behavior patterns
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and insights about bird populations
- **Data Quality**: Built-in data validation and quality assessment tools
- **Radius Analysis**: Find all sightings within a specified geographic radius

### Data Management

- **Import/Export**: Support for various data formats and migration tools
- **Ringing Records**: Manage detailed ringing information and metadata
- **Reporting**: Generate shareable reports with customizable time ranges

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and setup environment**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd vogelring
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

2. **Build and start services**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - API: http://localhost/api
   - Health check: http://localhost/health

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with TypeScript and Vuetify for Material Design components
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with PostgreSQL database
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose orchestration
- **Maps**: Leaflet for interactive mapping
- **Charts**: ECharts for data visualization

## Development

### Backend Development

The FastAPI backend is located in the `backend/` directory:

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # FastAPI application entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ connection.py    # Database connection and session management
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models.py        # SQLAlchemy ORM models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ routers/         # API route handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
```

### Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with three main tables:

- `ringings`: Bird ringing data
- `sightings`: Bird sighting observations
- `family_tree_entries`: Family relationship data

### Services

- **postgres**: PostgreSQL 15 database with persistent volumes
- **api**: FastAPI backend application
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file server

## Data Model

### Core Entities

- **Sightings**: Individual bird observations with location, date, and metadata
- **Birds**: Unique ringed birds with identification and tracking information
- **Ringing**: Detailed ringing records including location, date, and ringer information
- **Family Trees**: Breeding relationships and lineage tracking

### Key Features

- **Flexible Data Entry**: Support for partial readings and uncertain identifications
- **Geographic Precision**: Exact and approximate location tracking
- **Temporal Analysis**: Date-based filtering and seasonal pattern analysis
- **Relationship Mapping**: Partner and offspring relationship tracking

## API Documentation

The API provides comprehensive endpoints for:

- **Sightings**: CRUD operations, filtering, and search
- **Birds**: Metadata retrieval and suggestions
- **Analytics**: Friend analysis, seasonal patterns, radius searches
- **Ringing**: Ringing record management
- **Family**: Family tree and relationship management

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **System requirements**:

   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Sufficient storage for database and logs

2. **Configuration**:

   - Update `.env` with production values
   - Set up backup procedures for PostgreSQL data

3. **Monitoring**:
   - All services include health checks
   - Logs available via `docker-compose logs`
