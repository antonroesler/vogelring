# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Vogelring bird tracking application from AWS serverless architecture (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3) to a self-hosted solution running on a Raspberry Pi 5 with Cloudflare tunnels. The migration involves converting AWS Lambda functions to a containerized FastAPI backend, replacing DynamoDB and S3 pickle files with a local database, and setting up the entire stack with Docker Compose for single-user operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Migration from AWS Lambda to FastAPI

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the AWS Lambda functions to a FastAPI application, so that the backend can run locally on the Raspberry Pi without AWS dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current Lambda handler code is converted THEN the system SHALL create a FastAPI application with equivalent endpoints
2. WHEN the AWS Lambda Powertools dependencies are removed THEN the system SHALL replace them with standard FastAPI logging and error handling
3. WHEN the authentication system is removed THEN the system SHALL eliminate all Cognito dependencies and authentication middleware since Cloudflare Zero Trust handles authentication before requests reach the application
4. WHEN multi-user functionality is removed THEN the system SHALL eliminate all user context parameters and user-specific data filtering
5. WHEN the API endpoints are preserved THEN the system SHALL maintain the same REST API contract for frontend compatibility

### Requirement 2: Database Migration and Setup

**User Story:** As a user, I want all bird data stored in a local database, so that I can access my ringing and sighting records without depending on AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB ringing data is migrated THEN the system SHALL create a local PostgreSQL database with equivalent schema for ~6000 ringing records
2. WHEN S3 pickle file sighting data is migrated THEN the system SHALL store ~8000 sighting records in the same PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN ringing data is merged with sightings THEN the system SHALL use database JOINs to enrich sighting records with ringing information at the application level
4. WHEN database queries are optimized THEN the system SHALL support fast autocomplete and field suggestions across all columns
5. WHEN data relationships are preserved THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between ringings and sightings
6. WHEN full dataset retrieval is maintained THEN the system SHALL continue serving complete sighting datasets to frontend for fast client-side sorting and filtering
5. WHEN the database is containerized THEN the system SHALL run PostgreSQL in a Docker container with persistent volumes

### Requirement 3: Docker Compose Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire application stack running in Docker containers, so that deployment and management on the Raspberry Pi is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker Compose configuration is created THEN the system SHALL define services for the FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and frontend
2. WHEN containers are configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate resource limits suitable for Raspberry Pi 5 hardware
3. WHEN persistent storage is configured THEN the system SHALL use Docker volumes for database data and any file storage needs
4. WHEN networking is configured THEN the system SHALL enable proper inter-container communication and external access via Cloudflare tunnels
5. WHEN environment configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL use environment files for configuration management

### Requirement 4: Data Migration Tools

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want tools to migrate existing AWS data to the local database, so that no historical data is lost during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB export is processed THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to export ringing data from DynamoDB to local format
2. WHEN S3 pickle files are converted THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to convert pickle file sightings to database records
3. WHEN data validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity during migration
4. WHEN migration is executed THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing relationships and metadata
5. WHEN backup procedures are established THEN the system SHALL provide database backup and restore capabilities

### Requirement 5: Frontend Compatibility and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing Vue.js frontend to work seamlessly with the new backend, so that the user interface remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are maintained THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing REST API contracts
2. WHEN frontend configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL point to the new local backend URL
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL enable proper cross-origin requests for local development and production
4. WHEN static file serving is configured THEN the system SHALL serve the frontend through the same Docker Compose stack
5. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the system SHALL remove AWS-specific configuration and add local backend configuration

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic API tests to ensure the migrated backend functions correctly, so that I can verify the migration was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN happy path tests are created THEN the system SHALL test core CRUD operations for sightings and ringings
2. WHEN API endpoint tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL verify all major endpoints return expected responses
3. WHEN database integration tests are created THEN the system SHALL test database connectivity and basic queries
4. WHEN migration validation tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity after migration
5. WHEN test automation is configured THEN the system SHALL run tests as part of the Docker Compose setup

### Requirement 7: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast autocomplete and search functionality, so that data entry and retrieval remain efficient on the Raspberry Pi hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database indexes are created THEN the system SHALL optimize queries for autocomplete functionality across all searchable columns
2. WHEN query performance is optimized THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for typical operations
3. WHEN memory usage is optimized THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle the dataset size (~14,000 total records) within Raspberry Pi constraints
4. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed data like species lists and place names
5. WHEN database connections are managed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling appropriate for the expected load

### Requirement 8: Deployment and Operations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want simple deployment and operational procedures, so that the application can be easily maintained on the Raspberry Pi.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment scripts are created THEN the system SHALL provide simple commands to start/stop the entire stack
2. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL provide centralized logging for all services
3. WHEN monitoring is basic THEN the system SHALL provide health checks for all services
4. WHEN backup procedures are documented THEN the system SHALL include instructions for regular database backups
5. WHEN troubleshooting guides are provided THEN the system SHALL include common issue resolution steps
